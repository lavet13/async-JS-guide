// Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX and APIs
// so most of the code that we've been writing so far in the course has been synchronous code and synchronous simply means that the code is executed line by line,
// in the exact order of execution, that we defined in our code.

// üëâ Most code is synchronous;
// üëâ Synchronous code is executed line by line;
// üëâ Each line of code waits for previous line to finish;
// üëé Long-running operations block code execution

// Now this can create problems when line of code takes a long time to run. For example, we have an alert statement
// Now, as we've experienced in the past, this alert window will block the code execution, right? So nothing will happen on the page until we click that OK button.
// Because alert is blocking synchronous code.

// Now, most of the time synchronous code is fine and makes perfect sense. But imagine that execution would have to wait for example, for a five second timer to finish.
// That would just be terrible, right? Because meanwhile, nothing on the page would work during these five seconds. And so that's where asynchronous code comes into play.

// üëâ Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes;
// üëç Asynchronous code is non-blocking;
// üëâ Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task(e.g. timer) to finish it's work; // e.g. Example Given, i.e. - In Essence, In other words

// So in summary, asynchronous programming is all about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time. And this is essential to understand.
// We deferred an action into the future making the code asynchronous and non-blocking.
// Callback functions alone don't make code asynchronous, that's essential to keep in mind.

// img.src - is implemented in a asynchronous way üëç

// Event listeners alone don't make code asynchronous, just like callback functions alone, do also not make code asynchronous.
// Example: an event listener listening for a click on a button is not doing any work in the background. It's simply waiting for a click to happen, but it's not doing anything.
// No asynchronous behavior involved at all.

// AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) basically allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.
// Let's say that we have our JavaScript application running in the browser, which is also called the Client. And we want the application to get some data from a web server. And let's say
// the data about countries. So with AJAX, we can do an HTTP request to the server, which has this data. And the server will then send back a response containing that data that we requested.
// And this back and forth between Client and Server all happens asynchronously in the background, just the way we learned before.
// And there can even be different types of requests, like GET requests to receive data or POST requests to send data to a server.
// When we're asking a server to send us some data, this server usually contains a web API. And this API is the one that has the data that we're asking for. So an API is something pretty
// important, and so let's now see what an API and web APIs actually are.

// API stands for Application Programming Interface. In general terms and on the very high level of obstruction, an API is basically a piece of software that can be used by another piece
// of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other and exchange information and that's true not only for web development and JavaScript, but for programming in general;

// In JavaScript there are countless types of APIs, like the DOM API, Geolocation API that we have been using.
// Also, we can always implement a small and simple API in a class where we make some methods available as a public interface. So objects made from a class can be seen as self-contained
// encapsulated pieces of software that other pieces of software can interact with.

// "Online" API (the term that Jonas came up with) is essentially an application running on a web server, that receives requests for data, then retrieves this data from some database and then
// sends it back to the client.

// We can build our own web APIs (requires back-end development, e.g. with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs.

// Travel application:
// 3-rd party APIs:
// weather data
// data about countries
// Flights data
// Currency conversion data
// APIs for sending email or SMS
// Google Maps
// Millions of possibilities

// The possibitilies are really endless with APIs, and we can even say that APIs is what made the modern web as you know it possibly in the first place.
// XML is a data format, which used tobe widely used to transmit data on the web. However, these days basically no API uses XML data anymore. The term AJAX is just an old name
// that got very popular back in the day, and so it's still used today, even though we don't use XML anymore. So instead, most APIs these days use the JSON data format.
// So JSON is the most popular data format today because it's basically just a JavaScript object, but converted to a string.

    request.send(); // send off the request so that request then fetches the data in the background, and then once that is done, it will emit the load event,

    // console.log(request.responseText); // nothing as expected

    // as soon as the data arrives callback function will be called
    request.addEventListener('load', function () {
        const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);

// How the Web Works_ Requests and Responses
// Whenever we try to access a Web server, the browser which is the client, sends a request to the server and the server will then send back a response
// and that response contains the data or the Web page that we requested. And that's right, this process works the exact same way no matter if we're accessing
// an entire Web page or just some data from a Web API.
// And this whole process actually has a name and it's called the Request-response model or also the Client-server architecture.

// Domain name is actually not the real address of the server that we're trying to access. It's really just a nice name that is easy for us to memorize.
// But what this means is that we need a way of kind of converting the domain name to the real address of the server. And that happens through a so-called DNS.
// So DNS stands for domain name server and domain name servers are a special kind of server. So they are basically like the phone books of the Internet.
// So the first step that happens when we access any Web server is that the browser makes a request to a DNS and this special server will then simply match the
// web address of the URL to the server's real IP address. Actually this all happens through your Internet service provider, but the complete details don't really
// matter here. What you need to retain from this first part is that the domain is not the real address and that a DNS will convert the domain to the real IP address.
// And then after the real IP address has been sent back to the browser, we can finally call it. So this is how the real address looks like (https://104.27.142.889:443)
// So it still has the protocol, but then comes the IP address. And also the port that we access on the server. And this port number is really just to identify a specific
// service that's running on a server. So you can think of it like a sub address. This port number has nothing to do with the /rest/v2 resource
