// Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX and APIs
// so most of the code that we've been writing so far in the course has been synchronous code and synchronous simply means that the code is executed line by line,
// in the exact order of execution, that we defined in our code.

// üëâ Most code is synchronous;
// üëâ Synchronous code is executed line by line;
// üëâ Each line of code waits for previous line to finish;
// üëé Long-running operations block code execution

// Now this can create problems when line of code takes a long time to run. For example, we have an alert statement
// Now, as we've experienced in the past, this alert window will block the code execution, right? So nothing will happen on the page until we click that OK button.
// Because alert is blocking synchronous code.

// Now, most of the time synchronous code is fine and makes perfect sense. But imagine that execution would have to wait for example, for a five second timer to finish.
// That would just be terrible, right? Because meanwhile, nothing on the page would work during these five seconds. And so that's where asynchronous code comes into play.

// üëâ Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes;
// üëç Asynchronous code is non-blocking;
// üëâ Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task(e.g. timer) to finish it's work; // e.g. Example Given, i.e. - In Essence, In other words

// So in summary, asynchronous programming is all about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time. And this is essential to understand.
// We deferred an action into the future making the code asynchronous and non-blocking.
// Callback functions alone don't make code asynchronous, that's essential to keep in mind.

// img.src - is implemented in a asynchronous way üëç

// Event listeners alone don't make code asynchronous, just like callback functions alone, do also not make code asynchronous.
// Example: an event listener listening for a click on a button is not doing any work in the background. It's simply waiting for a click to happen, but it's not doing anything.
// No asynchronous behavior involved at all.

// AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) basically allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.
// Let's say that we have our JavaScript application running in the browser, which is also called the Client. And we want the application to get some data from a web server. And let's say
// the data about countries. So with AJAX, we can do an HTTP request to the server, which has this data. And the server will then send back a response containing that data that we requested.
// And this back and forth between Client and Server all happens asynchronously in the background, just the way we learned before.
// And there can even be different types of requests, like GET requests to receive data or POST requests to send data to a server.
// When we're asking a server to send us some data, this server usually contains a web API. And this API is the one that has the data that we're asking for. So an API is something pretty
// important, and so let's now see what an API and web APIs actually are.

// API stands for Application Programming Interface. In general terms and on the very high level of obstruction, an API is basically a piece of software that can be used by another piece
// of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other and exchange information and that's true not only for web development and JavaScript, but for programming in general;

// In JavaScript there are countless types of APIs, like the DOM API, Geolocation API that we have been using.
// Also, we can always implement a small and simple API in a class where we make some methods available as a public interface. So objects made from a class can be seen as self-contained
// encapsulated pieces of software that other pieces of software can interact with.

// "Online" API (the term that Jonas came up with) is essentially an application running on a web server, that receives requests for data, then retrieves this data from some database and then
// sends it back to the client.

// We can build our own web APIs (requires back-end development, e.g. with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs.

// Travel application:
// 3-rd party APIs:
// weather data
// data about countries
// Flights data
// Currency conversion data
// APIs for sending email or SMS
// Google Maps
// Millions of possibilities

// The possibitilies are really endless with APIs, and we can even say that APIs is what made the modern web as you know it possibly in the first place.
// XML is a data format, which used tobe widely used to transmit data on the web. However, these days basically no API uses XML data anymore. The term AJAX is just an old name
// that got very popular back in the day, and so it's still used today, even though we don't use XML anymore. So instead, most APIs these days use the JSON data format.
// So JSON is the most popular data format today because it's basically just a JavaScript object, but converted to a string.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// How the Web Works_ Requests and Responses
// Whenever we try to access a Web server, the browser which is the client, sends a request to the server and the server will then send back a response
// and that response contains the data or the Web page that we requested. And that's right, this process works the exact same way no matter if we're accessing
// an entire Web page or just some data from a Web API.
// And this whole process actually has a name and it's called the Request-response model or also the Client-server architecture.

// Domain name is actually not the real address of the server that we're trying to access. It's really just a nice name that is easy for us to memorize.
// But what this means is that we need a way of kind of converting the domain name to the real address of the server. And that happens through a so-called DNS.
// So DNS stands for domain name server and domain name servers are a special kind of server. So they are basically like the phone books of the Internet.
// So the first step that happens when we access any Web server is that the browser makes a request to a DNS and this special server will then simply match the
// web address of the URL to the server's real IP address. Actually this all happens through your Internet service provider, but the complete details don't really
// matter here. What you need to retain from this first part is that the domain is not the real address and that a DNS will convert the domain to the real IP address.
// And then after the real IP address has been sent back to the browser, we can finally call it. So this is how the real address looks like (https://104.27.142.889:443)
// So it still has the protocol, but then comes the IP address. And also the port that we access on the server. And this port number is really just to identify a specific
// service that's running on a server. So you can think of it like a sub address. This port number has nothing to do with the /rest/v2 resource that we want to access.
// So that resource will actually be sent over in the HTTP request as we will see in a moment.

// So once(–ø–æ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫—É) we have the real IP address, a TCP socket connection is established between the browser and the server. And so they are now finally connected.
// And this connection is typically kept alive for the entire time that it takes to transfer all files of the Website or all data. Now what are TCP and IP?
// Well TCP is the Transmission Control Protocol. And IP is the Internet Protocol. And together they are communication protocols that define exactly how data travels across
// the Web. They are basically the Internet's fundamental control system.
// Now it's time to finally make our request. And the request that we make is an HTTP request, where HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. So after TCP/IP, HTTP is another
// communication protocol. And by the way, a communication protocol is simply a system of rules that allows two or more parties to communicate. Now in case of HTTP, it's just
// a protocol that allows clients and Web servers to communicate. And that works by sending requests and response messages from client to server and back.

// Now a request message will look something like this. (e.g. https://restcountries.com/v2/name/russian)

/*
GET /v2/name/russian HTTP/1.1      start line: HTTP method + request target + HTTP version
                                           So about the HTTP methods, there are many available, but the most important ones are: GET, for simply requesting data,
                                           POST, for sending data and PUT and PATCH, to basically modify data.

                                           Now, if the request target was empty, so if it was just a slash basically then we would be accessing the website's route, 
                                           which is just https://restcountries.com/

Next part of the request are request headers, which is just some information that we sent about the request ifself. There are tons of standard different headers,
like what browser is used to make the request, at what time, the user's language and many, many more.

HOST: www.google.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 
Accept-Language: en-US

Now finally, in the case, we're sending data to the server. There will also be a request body, and that body will contain the data that we're sending, for example
coming from an HTML form. So that is the HTTP request. And I hope that it makes sense to you.

<BODY>

Now, of course, it's not us developers who manually write these HTTP requests, but it's still helpful and valuable that you understand what an HTTP request 
and also a response look like. Also, I want to mention that there's also HTTPS as you probably know. And the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS
is that HTTPS is encrypted using TLS or SSL which are yet some are protocols, but I'm not gonna bore you with these. But besides that, the logic behind HTTP requests
and responses still applies to HTTPS.


So our request is formed and now it hits the server, which will then be working on it until it has our data or Web page ready to send back. And once it's ready, it will
send it back using as you can guess, an HTTP response. And the HTTP response message actually looks quite similar to the request. So also with a start line, headers
and a body.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK                           start line: HTTP version + status code + status message(these are used to let the client know whether the request has been
                                          successful or failed. For example, 200 means, okay. And the status code that everyone knows is 404 which means page not found.
                                          So that is where this 404 code, that everyone already knew comes from.

Then the response headers are information about the response itself. So just like before, and there are a ton available and we can also make up our own actually.

Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2022
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Last part of the response is again, the body which is present in most responses, and this body usually contains the JSON data coming back from an API or the HTML of the 
Web page that we requested or something like that.

<BODY>

*/

// But in our imaginary example, we only just did one request to https://restcountries.com/v2/name/russian and got one response back. And that's how it's gonna work when
// all we do is to access an API. However, if it's a Web page that we're accessing, then there will be many more requests and responses. And that's because when we do
// the first request, all we get back is just the initial HTML file. That HTML file will then get scanned by the browser for all the assets that it needs in order to
// build the entire Web page like JavaScript, CSS files, image files, or other assets and then for each different file, there will be a new HTTP request made to the server.
// So basically this entire back and forth between client and server happens for every single file that is included in the Web page. However, there can be multiple requests
// and responses happening at the same time, but the amount is still limited because otherwise the connection would start to slow down. But anyway, when all the files
// have finally arrived, then the Web page can be rendered in the browser according to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript specifications that you already know.

// Now, as a final piece of the puzzle, let's talk about TCP/IP and figure out how this request and response data is actually sent across the Web.
// So we said before that TCP and IP are the communication protocols that define how data travels across the Web. Now I'm not gonna go into a lot of details here
// but here is what you need to know. So first the job of TCP is to break the requests and responses down into thousands of small chunks, called packets before they are
// sent. Once the small packets arrive at their final destination, TCP will reassemble all the packets into the original request or response. And this is necessary
// so that each packet can take a different route through the Internet. Because this way the message arrives at the destination as quick as possible, which would not be
// possible if we sent the entire data simply as a big chunk. So that would be like trying to go through dense traffic with like the biggest bus that you can imagine.
// So probably not a good idea. Now, as a second part, the job of the IP protocol is to actually send and route these packets through the Internet. So it ensures that
// they arrive at the destination they should go, using IP addresses on each packet. Okay, and that's it.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Promises and the Fetch API
// So the formal definition of a promise is that it's an object that is used basically as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation
// And if that sounds weird to you, we can also say that a promise is like a container for an asynchronously delivered value or even less formal. Let's say
// that a promise is a container for a future value. So there you go. That's the most distilled down definition of what a promise is. So a container or a placeholder
// for a future value, and the perfect example of a future value is the response coming from an AJAX call. So when we start the AJAX call, there is no value yet,
// but we know that there will be some value in the future. And so we can use a promise to handle this future value. To understand this concept even better, I like
// to use the analogy of a lottery ticket. So a promise is just like a lottery ticket. So when I buy a lottery ticket, essentially I buy the promise that I will receive
// some amount of money in the future if I guess the correct outcome. So I buy the ticket now with the prospect of winning money in the future and the lottery draw
// which determines if I get the money or not happens asynchronously. So of course I don't have to drop everything and keep waiting until the lottery draw happens.
// Now, in case I did get the correct outcome, then I will receive my money because I have my lottery ticket, which is the promise that I bought. Now, what's the big
// advantage of using promises? Well, there are two of them actually, first by using promises, we no longer need to rely on events and callback functions to handle
// asynchronous results, events and callback functions can sometimes cause(–º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞—Ç—å, –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏) unpredictable results. And so this is a big win already, but even
// better with promises, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations instead of nesting. And with this, we can finally escape callback hell which was
// our initial goal all along and by the way, promises are an ES6 feature. So they became available in JavaScript in 2015. And so by now, they are widely used by everyone
// Now, since promises work with asynchronous operations, they are time sensitive. So they change over time. And so promises can be in different states and this is
// what they call the life cycle of a promise. So in the very beginning we say that a promise is pending. And so this is before any value resulting from the asynchronous
// task is available. Now, during this time, the asynchronous task is still doing it's work in the background. Then when the task finally finishes, we say that the
// promise is settled(—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª—Å—è, —É—Å—Ç–æ—è–≤—à–∏–π—Å—è) and there are two different types of settled promises and that's fulfilled(–≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ) promises and
// rejected(–æ—Ç–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π) promises. So a fulfilled promise is a promise that has successfully resulted in a value(—É—Å–ø–µ—à–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª–æ –∫ –∑–Ω-—é) just as we expect it.
// For example, when we use the promise to fetch data from an API, a fulfilled promise successfully got that data and it's now available to being used. On the other hand,
// a rejected promise means that there has been an error during the asynchronous task. And example of fetching data from an API, an error would be for example when the
// user is offline and can't connect to the API server. Now going back to the analogy of our lottery ticket, the lottery draw is basically the asynchronous task which
// determines the result. Then once the result is available, the ticket would be settled. Then if we guessed the correct outcome, the lottery ticket will be fulfilled
// and we get our money. However, if we guessed wrong, then the ticket basically gets rejected. And all we did was waste our money. Now these different states are very
// important to understand because when we use promises in our code, we will be able to handle these different states in order to do something as a result of either
// a successful promise or a rejected one. Another important thing about promises is that a promise is only settled once. And so from there, the state will remain
// unchanged forever. So the promise was either fulfilled or rejected, but it's impossible to change that state. Now, these different states that I showed you here
// are relevant and useful when we use a promise to get a result, which is called to consume(–ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–ª—è—Ç—å) a promise. So we consume a promise when we already have a promise,
// for example, the promise that was returned from the fetch function. But in order for a promise to exist in the first place, it must first be built.
// So it must be created in the case of the fetch API, it's the fetch function that builds the promise and returns it for us to consume. So in this case, we don't have to
// build the promise ourselves in order to consume it. Now, most of the time we will actually just consume promises, which is also the easier and more useful part.
// But sometimes we also need to build a promise and not just consume it.
